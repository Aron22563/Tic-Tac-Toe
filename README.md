# Tic-Tac-Toe

Simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game built using ncurses.  
Currently a prototype and not fully functional yet.  

This project started as a way to learn ncurses and improve my C/C++ knowledge.  
Itâ€™s a small experiment focused on building an interactive terminal application step by step.
